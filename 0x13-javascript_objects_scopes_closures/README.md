# 0x13 - JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures

At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
* Why JavaScript programming is amazing
* How to create an object in JavaScript
* What `this` means
* What `undefined` means
* Why the variable type and scope is important
* What is a closure
* What is a prototype
* How to inherit an object from another
